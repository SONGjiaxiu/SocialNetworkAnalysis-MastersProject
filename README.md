# SocialNetworkAnalysis-MastersProject

This project contains the code for the project I undertook for the course "Social Network Analysis" during my masters. The goal of the project was to empirically study the infection models SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) and SIRS (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible) on different graph models. Specifically:
1. Barabasi-Albert model
2. Watts-Strogatz model
3. Modular graphs
4. Kronecker graphs

The plots depicting the spread of infection in each case can be found in the Figures folder. *Appropriate description for some plots are missing*.
